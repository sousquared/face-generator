# generate face images
The script keeps generating face images based on DCGAN.  
You can change how long the script produces the images just by changing `for i range():` part.

I trained the Generator using [pytorch tutorial's model][1] with Google Colaboratory.  

run the following code:  
`python generate_face.py`
